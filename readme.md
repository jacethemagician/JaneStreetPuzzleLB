# üß©Jane Street Puzzle Leaderboard

This program is designed to scrape and analyze the correct puzzle submissions from the [Jane Street Puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/) Archive. It provides insights into the most frequent solvers and visualizes the distribution of submission counts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è*WORK IN PROGRESS*
- For a one-time analytical script, just run ```python main.py```. No databases, no nothing, just a plain simple script.
- The rest of the modules are initial steps toward building a fully-fledged web-hosted service, which will consist of a backend server and frontend UI. You are more than welcome to inspect and provide feedback in the upcoming updates!
