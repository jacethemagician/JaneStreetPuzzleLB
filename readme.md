### Submission Distribution
![](20240905_submission_dist.png)

Note that there is a gap in the graph for submission counts less than 20; hence, the displayed leaderboard consists of solvers with more than 20 successful submissions. For a full list of the leaderboard, please use the script to generate it or reference the uploaded database at your convenience. (This part will be added later.)

## ‚ú®Features

### Scrape Submissions
Automatically fetch and process puzzle submissions.
  - **Set Page Limits:** Specify the number of pages to scrape, or leave it unset to scrape all available pages.
  - **Current Month Not Applicable:** Even though Jane Street posts the current month's solver, since it is continuously updated throughout the month and has not been shown on the solution page, the current month's correct submissions will only be counted at the beginning of the next month's puzzle when the solution is revealed.
  - **Older Puzzles Limitation:** No public submissions list exists before November 2015; submissions from before this date are not counted, affecting roughly 22 months/puzzles dating back to January 2014.

### Unique Names
Count the number of unique solvers.
  - **Counting Rule 1:** Treats each "name plate" as a whole. Multiple names listed together are counted as one group of solvers.
  - **Counting Rule 2:** The counting is not case-sensitive; variations in capitalization are considered the same solver (e.g., "XD" vs. "xd").

### Top K Solvers
List the top k solvers with their submission counts.

### Data Visualization
Display submission frequencies using a histogram.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è*WORK IN PROGRESS NOTICE*
 
- For a one-time analytical script, just run ```python main.py```. No databases, no nothing, just a plain simple script.
- The rest of the modules are initial steps toward building a web-hosted service. Might come some day.
